# Complete Password Reset Implementation & Testing Guide

## What I've Implemented

### 1. **Password Reset Request Flow**
- Added "Forgot Password?" link to the login form
- Created password reset form that collects user email
- Integrated with Supabase's `resetPasswordForEmail` function
- Configured proper redirect URL to `/reset-password`

### 2. **Password Reset Completion Flow**
- Created dedicated `ResetPasswordPage` component
- Added proper routing for `/reset-password` (accessible when not authenticated)
- Handles password reset tokens from email links
- Validates and processes new password submission
- Updates user password in Supabase database

### 3. **User Experience**
- Consistent UI/UX with existing auth components
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Loading states and form validation
- Automatic redirect back to login after successful reset

## Complete Testing Flow

### Step 1: Request Password Reset
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/`
2. Click "Forgot Password?" link on login form
3. Enter email address of existing user
4. Click "Send Reset Email"
5. You should see success message: "Password reset email sent! Check your inbox."

### Step 2: Check Email & Click Reset Link
1. Check the email inbox for the account you used
2. Look for password reset email from your Supabase project
3. Click the "Reset Password" link in the email
4. This will redirect to: `http://localhost:5173/reset-password?access_token=...&refresh_token=...&type=recovery`

### Step 3: Set New Password
1. You should see the "Set New Password" form
2. Enter new password (minimum 6 characters)
3. Confirm the new password
4. Click "Update Password"
5. You should see: "Password updated successfully! Please sign in with your new password."
6. User is automatically signed out and redirected to login

### Step 4: Login with New Password
1. Back on login form, enter email and NEW password
2. Should be able to login successfully

## Configuration

The password reset email will be sent from your Supabase project and will contain a link back to:
```
http://localhost:5173/reset-password?access_token=...&refresh_token=...&type=recovery
```

Make sure your Supabase project email templates are configured properly for password reset emails.

## Troubleshooting

### If email doesn't arrive:
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Verify email settings in Supabase dashboard
3. Check Supabase logs for email delivery issues

### If reset link shows 404:
1. Ensure development server is running on localhost:5173
2. Check that the route is properly configured
3. Verify the URL contains the required parameters

### If password update fails:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Supabase connection
3. Check that tokens haven't expired (usually 1 hour expiry)

The implementation is now complete and ready for full testing!
