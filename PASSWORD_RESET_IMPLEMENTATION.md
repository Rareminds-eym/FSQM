# Password Reset Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully added password reset functionality to the FSQM authentication system. The implementation includes a complete password reset flow with proper UI components and integration with Supabase authentication.

## Features Added

### 1. Password Reset Form
- New dedicated form for password reset requests
- Clean UI with email input field
- "Send Reset Email" button with loading state
- "Back to Login" navigation link

### 2. Updated Login Form
- Added "Forgot Password?" link below the password field
- Link triggers the password reset form

### 3. Enhanced Components

#### Auth.tsx
- Added `isResetPassword` state management
- Integrated `resetPassword` function from AuthContext
- Updated form submission handler to support password reset
- Added navigation between login and reset password modes

#### AuthForm.tsx
- Added support for password reset mode via `isResetPassword` prop
- New password reset form with email input
- Navigation props for switching between forms
- Updated interface to include optional reset password props

#### AuthHeader.tsx
- Added support for password reset title
- Updated header text to show "Reset Password" when in reset mode
- Added descriptive text for password reset flow

### 4. Authentication Integration
- Uses existing `resetPassword` function from AuthContext
- Leverages Supabase's `resetPasswordForEmail` method
- Proper error handling and user feedback via toast notifications

## User Flow

1. **Access Reset Form**: User clicks "Forgot Password?" on login form
2. **Enter Email**: User enters their email address
3. **Submit Request**: System sends reset email via Supabase
4. **Success Feedback**: User sees confirmation message
5. **Return to Login**: Automatically redirected back to login form

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [isResetPassword, setIsResetPassword] = useState(false);
```

### Form Handling
```typescript
if (isResetPassword) {
  const { error } = await resetPassword(formData.email);
  if (error) {
    toast.error(error.message);
    return;
  }
  toast.success("Password reset email sent! Check your inbox.");
  setIsResetPassword(false);
  setIsLogin(true);
}
```

### UI Components
- Password reset form is conditionally rendered
- AuthToggle is hidden during password reset
- Clean navigation between forms

## Security Features
- Email validation
- Proper error handling
- Rate limiting (inherited from existing auth system)
- Secure token generation via Supabase

## Testing
The implementation is ready for testing. Users can:
1. Navigate to the login page
2. Click "Forgot Password?"
3. Enter their email address
4. Receive a password reset email
5. Follow the link in the email to reset their password

## Next Steps
The password reset functionality is now complete and integrated with the existing authentication system. The feature maintains consistency with the existing UI design and follows the same patterns used throughout the application.
